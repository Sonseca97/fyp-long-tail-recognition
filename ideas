2. TODO : assignment module no feature normalizaition! tried 
3. TODO: using correctness to calculate klloss tried
4. Assginemtn module as long as knn right
---------------------to do ------------------------
5. precision recall curve for assignment module to assign threshold
6. erm try use val set as training to see if anything wrong 
7. feature engineering on the asm module
8. oversample
